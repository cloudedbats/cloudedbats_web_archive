# CloudedBats - on the web

This is a part of CloudedBats: http://cloudedbats.org

The web application is under development and will have functionality for:

- Configuration and control of a number of recording units.
- Graphical presentations of bat activity in near real time. For disconnected units the results should appear next time the unit is connected to internet.
- Upload, download and visualisation of selected wave files. 
- Species lists, and maybe other useful information.

Latest public version for test: http://test.cloudedbats.org 
and some documentation: http://test.cloudedbats.org/documentation

Contains only a species lists: http://test.cloudedbats.org/species and an early test version for the bat activity diagram: http://test.cloudedbats.org/bat_activity

The test web server is running in a virtual cloud server. Operating system is Ubuntu 16.04 and the web framework Django is used.
