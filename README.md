# CloudedBats - on the web

This is a part of CloudedBats: http://cloudedbats.org

The web application is under development and will have functionality for:

- Configuration and control of a number of recording units.
- Graphical presentations of bat activity in near real time. For disconnected units the results should appear next time the unit is connected to internet.
- Upload, download and visualisation of selected wave files. 
- Species lists, and maybe some other useful information.

The basic usage for a web server running cloudedbats_web is to manage a smaller cluster of detectors with internet connection, like the cloudedbats_wurb.

The web framework Django, written in Python, is used for cloudedbats_web.
